    <p>Lesson 1:
        Welcome, and in this tutorial, you're here to learn how to play a game called, League of legends! League of legends is an online multiplayer game that usually consists of 5 players  vs another 5 players. This game capitalizes on teamwork and synergy in order to gain dominance over the enemy team. Each player picks  a "champion" that usually fits under different playstyles. You could play a champion that has  a really aggressive playstyle, or you could play a champion that has a defensive playstyle, that is focused on protecting your team. The picture that is shown is one of the champions in League of legends, whose name is Thresh. Thresh is a support champion that helps protect his team and allows to hook enemy champions towards him.</p>

     <p>Lesson 2: 
         Welcome to lesson 2, about league of legends! Last lesson, we talked briefly about what League of legends was, and the kind of champions and playstyles that are included into the game. This lesson, we're going to talk about the map of League of legends, and what lanes are. The picture that you see under is called "Summoner's rift." In the game, you can either spawn on the red side of the map (upper side of the map) or, the blue side (lower side of the map) As you can see, there are 3 lanes sprouting from both sides. These lanes are known as top, middle and bottom. There are usually one top laner from each side, one mid, and two bottom laners from both sides. Tanks usually go to the top lane, assassins and mages go mid, and the marksmen and support go bottom. You may ask, but that's only 4 players, where is the fifth? The fifth resides in the jungle, and does not go into a lane. Instead, they kill jungle camps, which grants them various buffs and abilities in order to help other lanes. </p>

    <p>Lesson 3:
        Welcome to lesson 3. Last lesson, we talked about the different lanes for each champion and and difference between each lane. This lesson we're going to talk about the different roles in league of legends. There are 5 different that a team is usually composed of. A tank, A jungler, a mage or assassin, a marksmen and a support. 
        </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Tank: The role of the tank is to soak up damage, and to protect teammates. </li>
        <li>Jungler: The role of the jungler is to provide assistance to the lanes. How they usually provide assistance is flanking the enemy from behind, providing crowd control, and help lock the enemy laner down. </li>
        <li>Assassins: The role of assassins is to "burst" or one shot kill a squishy target. The meaning of burst is to deal a large amount of damage in a short amount of time.However, the role of an assassination comes with great risk, usually when you assassinate a target, as you can't get away from the enemy team.So think about your positioning very closely.</li>
        <li>Marksmen: Marksmen do little damage in early game, but ramp up into doing the most damage in the late game. Supports are usually with with the marksman, to protect them from junglers.</li>
        <li>Supports: Supports are important to any team, and there are different kind of supports. Some supports focus on healing, but other supports focus on team utility, in other words crowd control. Crowd control is a term used for abilities that lock down the target. Ex: Stuns, root, slows.</li>
        
        </ul>

    <p>Lesson 4:
    Welcome to lesson 4, There are objectives in League of legends that each team contests for. Baron Nashor, a giant sea snake, and dragon. Both of these objectives give you powerful buffs that grant advantages over the enemy. Dragon has buffs that stack the more times you kill it. With one kill, you gain more attack damage and ability power. 2 kills grant you turret destruction damage.3 kills give you 5% attack speed. 4 kills grant 15% increased damage against minions and monsters. and with the fifth and final stack, it grants you a burn over time with each auto attack you make, and doubles all the previous bonuses. Now Baron Nashor is the second objective that teams fight for. This monster doesn't spawn until 16 minutes into the game, which does take a while. However, do not underestimate it, as it does tons of damage to teams trying to gain the buff. When you do kill Baron Nashor, you gain more attack damage and ability power, an shorter recall back to base, and empowering minions in the lane. However, if you die with a Baron Nashor buff on, you lose the buff, but with dragon stacks, you do not, no matter what.</p>

    Welcome to lesson 5, in the last lesson, we talked about the different objectives and what the advantages were of gaining these objectives. We're almost done our lesson. This lesson, we're going to talk about mid-game and late-game. In league of legends, there are different phases of the game that each player must go through. There is the early game, where everyone is still in their respective lanes. It then transitions to mid-game, where people start grouping up together and start using teamwork to overpower the enemy. This is also the time where people start to gain objectives, and try to gain a lead over the enemy. Once the game has hit around 30-40 minutes in, this where late-game starts, and where the marksman start to do real damage. This is where one fight could cost the enemy team the game, so plays are really risky.

<p>Alright! You made it to the end! Congratulations! We're going to review what we covered over the last lessons and summarise it for you! In league of legends, there are different champions and playstyles, from an all agressive champion to a champion who protect their allies. 3 lanes that are for certain champions, for example tanks go to the top lane, assassins and mages go to the mid lane and the marksman and support go to the bottom lane. There are two objectives that both teams have to focus on, Dragon and Baron Nashor. Dragon buffs are not lost when you die, however with Baron Nashor buffs, you do. Finally, there are two phases that the game goes under after early game, where the game goes into a more team oriented style. Using each others strength and weaknesses to gain objectives. </p>
